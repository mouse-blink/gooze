## Roadmap

### Smart Test Execution
- [ ] Run only matching `*_test.go` files for each mutated source file
- [ ] Reduces test execution time by running relevant tests only

### Git Integration
- [ ] Mutate only files changed in git diff
- [ ] Focus mutation testing on modified code

### Performance & Scalability
- [x] `--parallel` flag for concurrent mutation testing
- [x] Sharding support for distributed execution across multiple machines
- [x] Compatible with parallel execution within shards
- [ ] Automatic report merging from multiple shards

### Reporting
- [ ] OCI artifact-based reports stored as container images
- [ ] Per-file mutation reports for granular analysis
- [ ] Index file with summary and aggregated metrics
- [ ] Incremental testing: merge branch results with master OCI artifacts for unchanged files

### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow templates
- [ ] GitLab CI pipeline configuration
